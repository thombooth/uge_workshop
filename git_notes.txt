master branch is a label that git creates for us when we initialize a repository

HEAD is another label that git creates for us when we create our first commit

HEAD is *not* a branch

# creats a new branch (label) called git-notes git branch git notes

GitHUB is a saucy saucy beast.  All kinds of pushing and pulling

Want a clone?  It can do that too!

What more could you ask for?
